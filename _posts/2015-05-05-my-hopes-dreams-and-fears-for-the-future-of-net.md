# Intro

* last post stirred discussion
* recent announcements: linux mac support, vs code, github
* excited

# Hopes and dreams

* open up to a new audience
* real oss communinity: e.g. coreclr on openbsd
* lots of open activity already happening on github
* new kind of contributors: actively creating libraries and content
* no more fear of .net

# Fears

* ms leaving the effort behind (e.g. silverlight)
  -> ms seems to be all in this time
  -> licens is MIT, so it's all in the open now
* only ms driven
* too radical change for current community 
* with ms at the steering wheel: don't keep reinventing the wheel
  e.g. new dependency injection

# Why does it matter

* for the .net community this is big
* we get access to lot of exciting tech (like docker, nosql stores)
* deployments <3
* c# is a good language, f# is a good language, the core library is ecellent
  the runtime is good
  people will see that and come

# Conclusion

hopes are a lot bigger than the fears
